## **About Dataset: Taxi Trip Data NYC**
### **NYC Cabs**
In this data there are two types of taxis, namely Yellow Cab (conventional taxi) and Uber. The Uber application has different rates in each city.

They do have some similarities:
*   fares based on a combination of time and distance,
*    charging passengers for any bridge or road tolls in addition to the fare.

There are differences between them:
1.  Surge Pricing
*   Yellow Cab does not have surge pricing, but riders might have to wait longer when demand exceeds supply. Yellow Cab adds a \$0.50 surcharge in the evening (8:00 PM to 6:00 AM) and a \$1 surcharge during rush hour (4:00 PM to 8:00 PM), Monday through Friday.
*   There is a surge pricing in Uber when demand exceeds supply. Surge pricing can take effect during rush hour, during a natural disaster, or during a random spike of requests on a Saturday afternoon. Uber claims these price increases are meant to encourage more Uber drivers to get out on the road, and that prices revert to normal when supply and demand even outâ€”capitalism at its finest. The Uber app notifies users of surge pricing when they request a ride.
2. Traffic
*   Uber does not differentiate between cruising and stop-and-go traffic.
*   Yellow Cab does charge different rates based on speed.
3. Extra Fare
*   Uber has price hikes during times of high demand.
*   Yellow Cab has extra rush hour fees.
4. Pick Up
*   If we do not bring an up-to-date smartphone, we will not be able to use Uber. New York City regulations prohibit street hails for private ride services (also called livery services).
*   Yellow Cab accept street hails anywhere in New York City.
5. Additional Fare
*   Uber's surge pricing will at least double our usual fare, and Uber has reported charging customers as much as \$39 per mile.
*   Yellow cab applied: for trips between Newark International Airport and New York City, the price is the regular metered fare, plus a $17.50 surcharge, plus tolls. For trips between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Manhattan, it is a flat fare of \$52 plus tolls. The regular metered fare applies to all trips to and from LaGuardia International Airport.
6. Payment
*   Uber automatically charges our account at the end of the ride. We can connect our credit card or PayPal account when we register for an Uber account.
*   When we take a Yellow Cab, we can pay with cash, credit card, or a payment app on our phone, like Apple Pay.
7. Tipping
*   Uber allows riders to tip their driver through the app after they have rated their ride, once complete. We have 30 days to add a tip once our ride is complete.
*   Tipping is customary for Yellow Cab rides. We can add the tip to our credit card or pay it in cash. Most riders who pay by credit card tip 20%, which might have something to do with the automatic tip options offered by the credit card machine: 20%, 25%, and 30%. We can always calculate our own tip or decline to tip altogether for bad service.
8. Pricing Structures
*   Uber: for a 5-mile, 10-minute trip going 25 miles per hour the entire way, uberX would cost \$2.55 base fare plus \$3.50 for the 10 minutes plus \$10.75 for the mileage, for a total of \$16.80. We can now add a tip on Uber if we choose.
*   Yellow Cab: the same 5-mile, 10-minute trip going 25 miles per hour, the entire way in a taxi would cost the base fare of \$2.50 plus 25 units at \$0.50 each, or \$12.50, for a total of \$15.00. It is customary to tip the driver 10% to 20%. This adds \$3 to the cab fare, for a total of \$18.
